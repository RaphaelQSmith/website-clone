          As part of the recruitment process, 888spectate collects and processes
          personal data relating to job applicants. 888spectate is committed to
          being transparent about how it collects and uses that data and to
          meeting its data protection and GDPR obligations.

        <h2>What information does 888spectate Collect?</h2>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <li> Name, Address, Contact Details</li>
              <li>Qualifications, skills, experience and employment history</li>
              <li>LinkedIn profile information (if provided by applicant)</li>
              <li>Information about the applicant’s entitlement to work in Ireland (i.e. Visa permit information)</li>
              <li>Earliest start date</li>
              <li>Where the applicant saw the position advertised</li>
          </ol>    
            <br>
          888spectate may collect this information in a variety of ways. For example, data might be contained in application forms, CVs, or collected through interviews or other forms of assessment, including online tests.
          <br>
          888spectate may also collect personal data about the applicant from other third parties, specifically references supplied by former employers. 888spectate will seek information from third parties only once a job offer to the applicant has been made and will inform the applicant that it is doing so.
          <br>
          Where a candidate has been submitted via a recruitment agency, it is the responsibility of the recruitment agency to collect and process the applicant’s data as per data protection and GDPR requirements before the candidate is submitted to 888spectate.

        <h2>Maintenance of Information</h2>
        <p>
          The application and the personal information submitted with it are stored on an applicant tracking system database which is maintained by an external service provider. This service provider is bound to Data Protection Legislation and is GDPR-compliant. Data may also be stored on other IT systems including email and an internal server (access restricted).

        <h2>Why does 888spectate process personal data?</h2>
        <p>
          888spectate needs to process data to enter into a contract with the applicant should they be successful in the recruitment process.
          <br>
          In some cases, 888spectate needs to process data to ensure that it is complying with its legal obligations. For example, to check an applicant’s eligibility to work in Ireland before employment starts.
          <br>
          Processing data from job applicants allows 888spectate to manage the recruitment process, assess and confirm a candidate’s suitability for employment and decide to whom to offer a job. 888spectate may also need to process data from job applicants to respond to and defend against legal claims.

    <section class="container__main-content">
      <div>
        <h2>Who has access to data?</h2>
        <p>
          The applicant’s information may be shared internally for the purposes of the recruitment process. This includes members of HR and the recruitment team, interviewers involved in the recruitment process and hiring managers.
          <br>
          888spectate will not share the applicant’s data with third parties. In addition, the applicant’s data will not be transferred outside the European Economic Area.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2>For how long does 888spectate keep data?</h2>
        <p>
          If an application is unsuccessful, 888spectate will ask for the applicant’s consent before it retains their data in relation to future employment opportunities for which the candidate may be suited. The applicant’s data will be held on 888spectate’s Applicant Tracking System for up to 1 year after the end of the recruitment process.
          <br>
          If the applicant does not wish for 888spectate to retain their data, they must request that it is deleted and they can withdraw their consent at any time during the retention period. In addition, the applicant can request to see what data 888spectate holds on them. 888spectate will respond to such a request within 30 days of receipt. At the end of the retention period (or once the applicant withdraws their consent), the applicant’s data is deleted or destroyed.
          <br>
          If 888spectate receives a candidate from a recruitment agency, we will obtain consent to retain the candidate’s data within 30 days of receipt.
          <br>
          If an application for employment is successful, personal data gathered during the recruitment process will be transferred to the applicant’s personnel file and retained during their employment. The periods for which the new hire’s data will be held will be provided to them in a privacy notice.

        <h2>Unsolicited Personal Data</h2>
        <p>
          Where 888spectate receives unsolicited personal data, e.g. speculative CVs at a time when we are not recruiting for a particular role, we will request the consent of the candidate to keep their data on file for a period of up to 1 year for any future employment opportunities.

        <h2>Your rights?</h2>
        <p>
          As a data subject, you have a number of rights. You can:

        <ol>
          <li>Access and obtain a copy of your data on request</li>
          <li>Require the organisation to change incorrect or incomplete data</li>
          <li>Require the organisation to delete or stop processing your data, for example where the data is no longer necessary for the purposes of processing</li>
          <li>Object to the processing of your data where the organisation is relying on its legitimate interests as the legal ground for processing</li>
        </ol>
          If you believe that 888spectate has not complied with your data protection rights, you can make a complaint to the Data Protection Commissioner.

        <p>
          You are under no statutory or contractual obligation to provide data to 888spectate during the recruitment process. However, if you do not provide the information, this may prevent 888spectate processing your application to completion.
